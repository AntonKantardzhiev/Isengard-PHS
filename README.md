~~not like we had a choice in the matter~~

This project is a website for a publishing house named Isengard PHS.
The site is meant to inform readers as to the authors, employees, and published books as well as providing means of contacting the business.

The project is hosted on github because really that's all we've got right now.

### LIBRARIES & DEPENDENCIES

This site uses:

[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) (experimental) (bit of a mistake really)
